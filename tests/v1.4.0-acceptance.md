# v1.4.0 MVP Acceptance Report

## Scope

Acceptance scope follows `TASKS_v1.4.0.md` (frozen MVP):

1. 7+1 site classification framework
2. Title + URL Top-1 classification
3. Dynamic page selection (homepage + key business page + mandatory article page)
4. Fallback behavior (sitemap-first, heuristic fallback, Hybrid fail-safe)

## Verification Checklist

| 7+1 classification defined | PASS | `references/site-classification-mvp.md` |
| Title + URL scoring implemented | PASS | `tests/evaluate_site_classification_v140.py` |
| Top-1 output behavior | PASS | `tests/v1.4.0-site-classification-results.json` |
| Dynamic page naming aligned in template | PASS | `references/report-template.en.md`, `references/report-template.zh-CN.md` |
| Mandatory article-page rule documented | PASS | `SKILL.md`, `TASKS_v1.4.0.md` |

## Effectiveness (Real-World Sample Run)

- Sample file: `tests/site_classification_samples_v140.json`
- Evaluator: `tests/evaluate_site_classification_v140.py`
- Result file: `tests/v1.4.0-site-classification-results.md`

Current run:

- Reachable sites tested: 9
- Correct classifications: 9
- Hit rate on reachable set: 100.00%
- Unreachable/blocked sample: 1 (`https://www.newegg.com`, HTTP 400)

## Conclusion

v1.4.0 MVP acceptance criteria are met for the current test scope.

Known boundary:

- Some e-commerce sites may block automated fetch requests (anti-bot), reducing measurable sample size.
- Expanded confidence/interaction enhancements are deferred to v1.4.1.
