# v1.4.1 Acceptance Report

## Scope

Acceptance scope follows `TASKS_v1.4.1.md`:

1. `Title + URL + Nav` classification
2. Top-2 + confidence output
3. Low-confidence quick confirmation strategy (non-blocking default)
4. Article-page secondary search enhancement
5. Appendix explainability fields
6. Metrics-based validation

## Evidence Files

- `tests/evaluate_site_classification_v141.py`
- `tests/site_classification_samples_v141.json`
- `tests/v1.4.1-site-classification-results.md`
- `tests/v1.4.1-site-classification-results.json`

## Run Summary

- Tested: 10
- Correct: 10
- Classification accuracy: 100.00%
- Article-page hit rate: 60.00%
- Secondary article hits: 1
- Fallback/confirmation coverage: 50.00%
- Errors: 0

## Quantified Improvement

Article hit metric comparison (same v1.4.1 sample set):

- Primary-path-only baseline: 50.00% (5/10)
- v1.4.1 final (with secondary search): 60.00% (6/10)
- Improvement: **+10 percentage points**

## Conclusion

v1.4.1 enhancement goals are met for current scope:

- Top-2 + confidence is available
- Low-confidence non-blocking strategy is defined and testable
- Article-page discovery improves with secondary-path logic
- Explainability artifacts are available for report appendix
